### Hi, I'm MiloÅ¡ ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™ve been enamored with software development since the age of 6. Over 30 years later, it remains my greatest passion.

I love to obsess around the developer experience, tooling, exploring new technologies and new ways of thinking about software.
I never claim to know what's the best language, tool or pattern to use, but I like to try everything and attempt to deduce what might work well for the task at hand.

In addition to coding, Iâ€™m very used to working with people and putting the right people together to get the ball moving.


My last full time position was as a technical lead / CTO of a small iGaming startup company.
Recently I have focused on doing personal projects, freelance work and talking to other people in the industry.
