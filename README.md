### Hi, I'm MiloÅ¡ ðŸ‘‹ (He/Him)

Iâ€™ve been enamored with software development since the age of 6. Over 25 years later, it remains my greatest passion.

My focus is on improving the developer experience and tooling, exploring new technologies, and finding the right balance for my team between completing tasks and maintaining code quality and maintainability.
In addition to coding, Iâ€™ve taken on managerial roles, devoting about half of my attention to creating a highly functioning team and looking at what is next on the horizon.
I split my coding time equally to frontend and backend work.

I'm currently working as a CTO of an iGaming startup company.
